# Database and DataStorage
# https://dexie.org/ 
Research concluded we go with Dexiedb to replace pouchdb for the meantime
after project is successfully deployed we would have versions that make use of pouchdb for 
educational purposes and how both are implemented 

#Indexeddb | https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/IndexedDB_API
this is the core database of the app
Its being persisted : meaning when data exceeds the quota nothing is lost and still kept.

#PouchDB | https://pouchdb.com/
we will introduce pouchdb in order to sync data from the app to cloudserver | IBM-Cloudant or any compatible document-based cloud database.
For Offline first system.
